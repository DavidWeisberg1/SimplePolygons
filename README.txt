Run the code by passing an argument n for the number of points. 
For example, if you want to generate a polygon with 1000 points, run:
$python3 SimplePolygons.py 1000
Since the goal is to generate complex polygons, the results are best when
the number of points is at least 40 points so as to have at least a 2X2
matrix of cells where we are letting there be 10 points per cell.
